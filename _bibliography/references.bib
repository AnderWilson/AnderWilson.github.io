abstract = {RATIONALE Impact of ambient pollution upon children's asthma may differ by sex, and exposure dose and timing. Psychosocial stress can also modify pollutant effects. These associations have not been examined for in utero ambient nitrate exposure. OBJECTIVES We implemented Bayesian distributed lag interaction models (BDLIMs), to identify sensitive prenatal windows for the influence of NO3- on child asthma, accounting for effect modification by sex and stress. METHODS Analyses included 752 mother-child dyads. Daily ambient nitrate (NO3-) exposure during pregnancy was derived using a hybrid chemical transport (Geos-Chem)/land-use regression model and natural-log (ln) transformed. Prenatal maternal stress was indexed by a negative life events (NLEs) score [high (≥3) vs. low (<3)]. The outcome was clinician-diagnosed asthma by age 6 years. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Most mothers were Hispanic (54%) or Black (29%), had ≤high school education (66%), never smoked (80%), and reported low prenatal stress (58%); 15% of children developed asthma. BDILMs adjusted for maternal age, race, education, pre-pregnancy obesity, atopy, and smoking status identified two sensitive windows-7-19 and 33-40 weeks gestation-during which increased NO3- was associated with greater odds of asthma, specifically among boys born to mothers reporting high prenatal stress. Cumulative effects of NO3- across pregnancy were also significant in this subgroup (OR=2.64, 95%CI=1.27-5.39; per IQR increase in ln-NO3-). CONCLUSIONS Prenatal NO3- exposure during distinct sensitive windows was associated with incident asthma in boys concurrently exposed to high prenatal stress.},

abstract = {When estimating the effect of an exposure or treatment on an outcome it is important to select the proper subset of confounding variables to include in the model. Including too many covariates increases mean square error on the effect of interest while not including confounding variables biases the exposure effect estimate. We propose a decision-theoretic approach to confounder selection and effect estimation. We first estimate the full standard Bayesian regression model and then post-process the posterior distribution with a loss function that penalizes models omitting important confounders. Our method can be fit easily with existing software and in many situations without the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, resulting in computation on the order of the least squares solution. We prove that the proposed estimator has attractive asymptotic properties. In a simulation study we show that our method outperforms existing methods. We demonstrate our method by estimating the effect of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure on birth weight in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.},

@article{Wilson2017a,
abstract = {Epidemiological research supports an association between maternal exposure to air pollution during pregnancy and adverse children's health outcomes. Advances in exposure assessment and statistics allow for estimation of both critical windows of vulnerability and exposure effect heterogeneity. Simultaneous estimation of windows of vulnerability and effect heterogeneity can be accomplished by fitting a distributed lag model (DLM) stratified by subgroup. However, this can provide an incomplete picture of how effects vary across subgroups because it does not allow for subgroups to have the same window but different within-window effects or to have different windows but the same within-window effect. Because the timing of some developmental processes are common across subpopulations of infants while for others the timing differs across subgroups, both scenarios are important to consider when evaluating health risks of prenatal exposures. We propose a new approach that partitions the DLM into a constrained functional predictor that estimates windows of vulnerability and a scalar effect representing the within-window effect directly. The proposed method allows for heterogeneity in only the window, only the within-window effect, or both. In a simulation study we show that a model assuming a shared component across groups results in lower bias and mean squared error for the estimated windows and effects when that component is in fact constant across groups. We apply the proposed method to estimate windows of vulnerability in the association between prenatal exposures to fine particulate matter and each of birth weight and asthma incidence, and estimate how these associations vary by sex and maternal obesity status in a Boston-area prospective pre-birth cohort study.},

abstract = {In many applications there is interest in estimating the relation between a predictor and an outcome when the relation is known to be monotone or otherwise constrained due to the physical processes involved. We consider one such application--inferring time-resolved aerosol concentration from a low-cost differential pressure sensor. The objective is to estimate a monotone function and make inference on the scaled first derivative of the function. We proposed Bayesian nonparametric monotone regression which uses a Bernstein polynomial basis to construct the regression function and puts a Dirichlet process prior on the regression coefficients. The base measure of the Dirichlet process is a finite mixture of a mass point at zero and a truncated normal. This construction imposes monotonicity while clustering the basis functions. Clustering the basis functions reduces the parameter space and allows the estimated regression function to be linear. With the proposed approach we can make closed-formed inference on the derivative of the estimated function including full quantification of uncertainty. In a simulation study the proposed method performs similar to other monotone regression approaches when the true function is wavy but performs better when the true function is linear. We apply the method to estimate time-resolved aerosol concentration with a newly-developed portable aerosol monitor. The R package bnmr is made available to implement the method.},

@article{Wilson2014c,
abstract = {Climate change is expected to alter the distribution of ambient ozone levels and temperatures which, in turn, may impact public health. Much research has focused on the effect of short-term ozone exposures on mortality and morbidity while controlling for temperature as a confounder, but less is known about the joint effects of ozone and temperature. The extent of the health effects of changing ozone levels and temperatures will depend on whether these effects are additive or synergistic. In this paper we propose a spatial, semi-parametric model to estimate the joint ozone-temperature risk surfaces in 95 US urban areas. Our methodology restricts the ozone-temperature risk surfaces to be monotone in ozone and allows for both nonadditive and nonlinear effects of ozone and temperature. We use data from the National Mortality and Morbidity Air Pollution Study (NMMAPS) and show that the proposed model fits the data better than additive linear and nonlinear models. We then examine the synergistic effect of ozone and temperature both nationally and locally and find evidence of a nonlinear ozone effect and an ozone-temperature interaction at higher temperatures and ozone concentrations.},
