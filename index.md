I am Associate Professor in the [Department of Statistics](http://www.stat.colostate.edu/) at Colorado State University. 
He is a faculty member in the [Partnership on Air Quality Climate and Health (PACH)](https://www.research.colostate.edu/pach/) at CSU and organizes the [environmental biostatistics working group](https://envbiostat-csu.github.io) at CSU.

I received his PhD from the Department of Statistics at North Carolina State University. 
During that time, he was an ORISE fellow at the US Environmental Protection Agency. 
I was a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Biostatistics at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. 
I received a BA in mathematics from the University of Vermont and previously worked at Mathematica Policy Research.

My research is motivated by relevent scientific problems primarily in the area of environmental health. I develop statistical methodology and software to analyze complex datasets and answer emerging questions. I collaborate with researchers in several fields to conduce transdisciplanary research related to environmental health and other fields. Ander research program focuses on developing statistical methods for environmental health research. Current areas of research includes:
  - Health effects of exposure to environmental mixtures
  - Precision environmental health
  - Effect heterogeneity
  - Health effects of maternal exposure to chemicals on birth and children's health outcomes
  - Bayesian methods
  - Machine learning
  - Health effects of wildfire smoke exposure
